	Choose whatever zone you like.
 
	In Boot Disk, choose ```Ubuntu 14.04```, and the disk size should be larger than 40GB.
	On the bottom of the page, click ```Management, disk, networking, access & security options``` to show more options. Inside of this, click into the tab ```Networking``` and choose ```New static IP``` instead of ```Ephemeral```. Enter a name for your IP. Google will assign a IP for you.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get -y install docker.io
sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
sudo docker build https://github.com/fossasia/susi_server.git
```

Once finished, the last line will provide the image ID, like ```Successfully built 4e11208a7b34```. Copy or remember this id, we will need this id to tag the image.
Tag your image by entering ```sudo docker tag YOUR_IMAGE_ID susi```. In my case, we enter ```sudo docker tag 4e11208a7b34 susi```
Run our server by entering:
```
sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 susi
```
Enter your assigned IP address into your browser to check if it is working.
